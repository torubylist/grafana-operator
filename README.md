# Grafana Operator

**not meant for production use**

This Operator is based on the `grafana-watcher` sidecar from [Prometheus Operator](https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator) and the [Rolebinding Operator](https://github.com/treacher/namespace-rolebinding-operator) example.

Currently it simply watches for new `ConfigMaps` and if they define the annotation `grafana.net/dashboards` as `"true"` it will `POST` each dashboard from the `ConfigMap` to Grafana.

Additionally, if the `ConfigMaps` define the annotation `grafana.net/datasource` as `"true"` it will `POST` each daatsource from the `ConfigMap` to Grafana. This requires Grafana 5.x.

You can set folder name of grafana and homepage of grafana, and filter configmaps by namespace.
## Usage
```
--run-outside-cluster # Uses ~/.kube/config rather than in cluster configuration
--grafana-url # Sets the URL and authentication to use to access the Grafana API
```

## Development

### Build from source
1. `make install_deps`
2. `make build`
3. `./bin/grafana-dashboard-watcher --run-outside-cluster 1 --grafana-url <GRAFANA URL> 
--grafana-namespace <GRAFANA-NAMESPACE> --grafana-folder <FOLDER-NAME> 
--grafana-homepage <HOMEPAGE>`

Easiest way to install just Grafana to Kubernetes for playing with helm: `helm install stable/grafana` then add the dashboards, `kubectl apply -f examples/grafana-dashboards.yaml`

## Needed

List of some of the capabilities needed to make this operator functional.

* Grafana CRD. The Operator should handle launching configured Grafana deployments.
* Support for datasources in configmaps being created in the deployed Grafanas.
* Post all existing dashboards to new Grafana deployments.
* Label based association of Grafana instances and its dashboards/datasources?
* Cross namespace support?
